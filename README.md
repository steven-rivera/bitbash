## Features

### Redirection

- `<` — Redirect `stdin` from a file
- `>` / `>>` — Redirect `stdout` to a file (overwrite or append)
- `2>` / `2>>` — Redirect `stderr` to a file (overwrite or append)
- `&>` / `&>>` — Redirect both `stdout` and `stderr` to a file (overwrite or append)

### Piping

- `|` — Pipe `stdout` of one command into `stdin` of another

### Autocomplete

- `TAB` — Attempt to complete or partially complete a command name
- `TAB TAB` — If multiple matches exist, print all possible completions

###  Quoting

- `'...'` — Preserve literal value of characters inside single quotes
- `"..."` — Similar to single quotes, but supports escape sequences like `\\`, `\$`, and `\"`

###  Command History

- `↑` — Browse to the previous command
- `↓` — Browse to the next command
